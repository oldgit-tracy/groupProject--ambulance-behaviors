	<h2>Data</h2>
	The data we used for these two visualizations are two columns from the data set which you can find <a href = "https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service-December-2016/97i8-upbq?category=Public-Safety&view_name=Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service-December-2016"> here </a> We used Transport.DtTm and Hospital.DtTm. To subset this data set, we used R and removed all values which were empty.

	<h2>Visualization</h2>
	This is our visualization. It shows the distribution of how longs it took ambulances to get from the scene of injury to the hospital. The second graph shows a closer look at the negative times- which don't make any literal sense.
